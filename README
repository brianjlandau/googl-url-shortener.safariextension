This is a simple Safari Extension for shortening the current page with the goo.gl URL shortener.

It provides both a Toolbar Item and a context menu item.

Currently it doesn't auto copy it into the pasteboard as I'm unclear how that can be done with the Safari API yet.
If someone knows that would be a great contribution.
